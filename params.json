{"name":"SPECTACLE","tagline":"","body":"### What is SPECTACLE\r\nSPECTACLE is a software package that can evaluate the quality of error correction tool outputs. It can handle DNA and RNA sequencing data from any sequencing technology, and differentiate heterozygosity from sequencing errors.\r\nWe have also designed input read sets that stress the challenges in error correction such as heterozygosity, coverage variation, and repeats. These reads can be used as standard inputs for the evaluation of error correction tools.\r\n\r\n### How to install SPECTACLE\r\nYou can download the latest release of SPECTACLE [here](https://github.com/thirtyeggs/spectacle/releases).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tar zxvf spectacle-X.XX.tar.gz\r\n$ cd spectacle-X.XX\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to run SPECTACLE\r\nYou can get more information on how to evaluate error correction tools using SPECTACLE from [SPECTACLE User Guide](http://spectacle.csl.illinois.edu/user/yunheo1/spectacle/doc/SPECTACLE_User_Guide_V0.02.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Data Sets\r\nMore detailed information on the data sets is available in [this article]()\r\n#### 1.
